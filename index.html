            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>From my earliest exposure to Information Technology, I understood that reliability is the cornerstone of software—ensuring data safety amid breakthroughs. My passion for creating dependable systems stems from witnessing how technology failures can disrupt small businesses that lack robust IT infrastructure. Through my dual degree in Computer Science and Business Administration, combined with hands-on experience in VR development, full-stack engineering, and research, I've focused on building systems that are not only innovative but fundamentally reliable and user-centered.</p>
            <p>Currently, I'm working on VR interface research at HKU's HIS Lab while completing my final-year project on blockchain-based age verification. I'm particularly interested in how emerging technologies like VR/AR and blockchain can be made accessible and dependable for real-world business applications.</p>
