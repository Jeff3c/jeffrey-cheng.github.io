    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am a final-year double degree student pursuing BEng in Computer Science and BBA in Information Systems at The University of Hong Kong. My academic and research interests center on <strong>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</strong>, particularly in developing intuitive and reliable <strong>VR/AR systems</strong> that address real-world challenges. </p>
    
    <p>Through my research at HKU's Human Interaction Systems Lab, I have led the development of advanced 3D user interfaces and VR training systems, with work recognized as a finalist at <strong>IEEE VR 2025</strong>. My experience spans the full development lifecycle—from user research and interface design to performance optimization and deployment—resulting in systems that achieve 90+ FPS in VR environments and demonstrate measurable improvements in training efficiency. </p>
    
    <p>Beyond VR/AR, I am passionate about <strong>privacy-preserving technologies</strong>. My final-year project, VerifyID, applies blockchain and zero-knowledge proofs to enable secure identity verification without compromising user privacy.  This work reflects my commitment to building systems that are not only technologically sophisticated but also ethically responsible and accessible. </p>
    
    <p>I am seeking opportunities to pursue graduate studies in Computer Science, where I can deepen my research in HCI, VR/AR systems, and privacy-preserving technologies while contributing to cutting-edge work in these domains.</p>
